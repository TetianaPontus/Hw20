<h1> Most Popular Albums: </h1>
<h1>3. Beauty Behind the Madness (2015) </h1>
<p id="test_id">After the disappointment of Kiss Land, the Weeknd managed to pull off a rare feat, course-correcting out of the creative dead end he had been circling with his new production team. For Beauty Behind the Madness, he leans on his early collaborator Illangelo to reclaim some of the swagger and sonic texture from his early mixtapes, while wielding a big enough budget to recruit Max Martin for the first time.The resulting cocktail splits the difference between his familiar formula and the radio-ready hooks of mainstream pop, delivering Cant Feel My Face  one of the catchiest tunes the Weeknd has ever recorded  by swapping Tesfayes typically overt explicit references for implausibly deniable imagery delivered with a wink and a nod. 
</p>
<h1>2. After Hours (2020) </h1>
<p id="test_id">The Weeknd was already a huge star when After Hours dropped, but this is the record that helped put him on the Super Bowl stage. Hours is a perfectly polished synth-pop record, evidenced by Blinding Lights, the catchiest hit of his career and quite possibly the last decade. The Weeknd doesnt abandon his love for early-morning pharmaceuticals, but its a testament to how sophisticated his songwriting has become that he can name-drop weed, coke, MDMA, and Xanax in a single song (Faith) without sounding completely goofy. Its different enough from the initial Trilogy that the uninitiated could be forgiven for thinking it was a new artist altogether. 
</p>
<h1>1. House of Balloons (2011) </h1>
<p id="test_id">Nocturnal, brooding, and drenched in self-loathing, House of Balloons remains one of the most compelling debuts from an R&B singer this century. In some ways, the Weeknd is still chasing the high from this record, an irresistible mood piece cloaked in mystery. With clever interpolations of left-of-center samples from Beach House (The Party and the After Party and Loft Music) and Siouxsie and the Banshees (House of Balloons), Tesfaye croons soulless lyrics over soulful compositions, grooming groupies and corrupting the innocent. Its equal parts lecherous and melodic, capturing just a sliver of the thrill of the dangers of self-destruction.
